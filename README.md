# harvester-cloud
A project for deploying Harvester on cloud providers instead of bare-metal infrastructure.

## Why?
To make it easy for anyone to spin up a Harvester environment for labs, testing, and basic PoCs.

:warning: **Not intended for production use.**

## How the repository is structured

```console
.
├── modules/
│   └── ...
├── projects/
│   └── ...
├── docs/
│   └── ...
└── # images/, LICENSE, etc.
```

The `modules/` directory contains templates for deploying VMs on different cloud providers (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and DigitalOcean), along with all necessary scripts to configure Harvester.

The `projects/` directory combines modules to create different deployment recipes based on specific use cases. For example, you can deploy a 3-node Harvester cluster on Google Cloud VMs or, given an existing Harvester cluster, deploy images, networks, and additional VMs.
